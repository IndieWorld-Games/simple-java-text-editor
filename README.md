I am an aspiring programmer who graduated from the University of Wyoming with a degree in Computer Engineering. It's been a few years since I graduated, so I'm working on refreshing my skills.

I currently work in phone tech support. Naturally, I am desparate to get out of this job and into something more prestigeous.
